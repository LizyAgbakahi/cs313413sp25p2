Answers to questions for project 2

TestIterator.java

TODO Question. Is there a difference behaviorally if an ArrayList or LinkedList is used?

 Answer: No, there is no behavioral difference in how the Iterator works in this test. Both
 ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface so they follow the same iteration and ordering behavior.

TODO Question: What happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))?

Answer: If you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77)), only the first occurrence of 77 would be removed in the list.
